# AES Image Encryption

This project demonstrates image encryption and decryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. It provides a web interface for uploading, encrypting, and decrypting images, with integration to Firebase Cloud Storage for storing encrypted images.

## Features

- Upload images for encryption.
- Encrypt uploaded images using AES.
- Decrypt encrypted images.
- Integrated with Firebase Cloud Storage for encrypted image storage.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Cloud Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage
- Encryption: AES
